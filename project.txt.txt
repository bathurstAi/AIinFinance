TEAM PROJECT: Teams will select a topic/project; prepare a written report, and a 20-30 minute presentation in the final week of class. The written report will be made available to all other teams so that everyone may benefit.  The project must apply machine learning tools to a particular financial application. Examples of possible applications could include but are not limited to: fraud detection, bankruptcy modelling, portfolio optimization, risk management/measurement or the development of a hedge fund or investment trading strategy. Basically this project is open to your imagination. The only requirement is that it must somehow be related to financial analytics in some way. Teams should get prior approval for their topic no later than 2 weeks before the project presentation.
