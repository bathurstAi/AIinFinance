Artificial AI in Finance project for MMAI
TEAM PROJECT: Teams will select a topic/project; prepare a written report, and a 20-30 minute presentation in the final week of class. The written report will be made available to all other teams so that everyone may benefit.  The project must apply machine learning tools to a particular financial application. Examples of possible applications could include but are not limited to: fraud detection, bankruptcy modelling, portfolio optimization, risk management/measurement or the development of a hedge fund or investment trading strategy. Basically this project is open to your imagination. The only requirement is that it must somehow be related to financial analytics in some way. Teams should get prior approval for their topic no later than 2 weeks before the project presentation.

The selected topic is the optimization of pricing strategy for a loan portfolio.  The goal will be to determine the interest rate of each borrower in order to reduce the risk to the lender and increase profit for the lending company by determine the amount of interest to charge a borrower while insuring that the account will not go into default.

 Data by the Lending Club will be used, both declined user data and accepted loan data.  Additional features to work into the model are the following:
-	How to account for fairness? (some type of sentiment analysis?)
-	How do we mitigate bias?
-	 Ensure that affordability of the borrower is maintained (only those that can afford should be offered a loan)
